These files are the source CAD files created in Solidworks.

Solidworks is a very expensive CAD program that I had access to through my University but no longer have access to.

I doubt these will be useful to anyone but I have added them for completeness.

I designed it using variables so that the clearances could be tweaked after everything was designed. These can be found in equations.txt
